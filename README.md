# Lunar Helper ([lunar-monitor](https://github.com/Underrout/lunar-monitor) compatible version)

This version of Lunar Helper is slightly altered in order to be compatible with lunar-monitor, which you can read all about [here](https://github.com/Underrout/lunar-monitor#lunar-monitor). Long story short, using Lunar Helper and lunar-monitor in combination should help make managing a SMW hack project with git somewhat more streamlined.

Setup is exactly the same as for the regular Lunar Helper version. Make sure to read through [Lunar Helper's](https://github.com/MaddyThorson/LunarHelper) **and** lunar-monitor's setup instructions or things might not work perfectly.
