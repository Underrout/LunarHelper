# Lunar Helper ([lunar-monitor](https://github.com/Underrout/lunar-monitor) compatible version)

This version of Lunar Helper is slightly altered in order to be compatible with lunar-monitor, which you can read all about [here](https://github.com/Underrout/lunar-monitor#lunar-monitor). Long story short, using Lunar Helper and lunar-monitor in combination should help make managing a SMW hack project with git somewhat more streamlined (though there are still plenty of things I'd like to improve on in the future if Lunar Magic gets relevant updates).

Setup is exactly the same as for the regular Lunar Helper version except that no level directory needs to be specified in the Lunar Helper config files, since lunar-monitor handles level exports. Make sure to read through Lunar Helper's setup **and** lunar-monitor's setup or things might not work perfectly.
