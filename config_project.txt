-- this is an example project file

-- (A lot of this file is commented out, just to show you potential configurations you can use)
-- Lunar Helper will load every config_*.txt file in its directory.
 
-- if defined, the initial patch will be applied before any other steps
-- this is important because there are certain things that Lunar Magic inserts that other 
-- tools and resources may rely on
-- two initial patches with pretty standard setups are provided in the "initial_patches" folder 
-- with this tool for your convenience

-- build order

-- Specifies the order in which resources are inserted
-- into the ROM when you use the Build function, feel free to 
-- move items around or remove them if you're not using them

-- The same step can be specified multiple times if you require things
-- to be inserted two or more times at different points

-- You can also specify individual patches in this list by just 
-- writing out their path as it appears in the patches list above, 
-- this patch will then be inserted at that step instead of being
-- applied at the same time as the other Patches

-- By default, most things in this list are commented out, which 
-- works well for a vanilla hack
