-- this is an example project file
-- Lunar Helper will load every config_*.txt file in its directory.
-- For a solo project, you could simply configure everything in one big config file,
-- but for collabs it's a good idea to split config files between things that 
-- are relative to the project path like levels, and tools like Lunar Magic that each
-- collaborator may have installed at a different location, as in this example
-- (see config_user.txt for the rest of the example configuration)
 
 
-- if defined, the initial patch will be applied before any other steps
-- It's good idea to open your clean ROM in Lunar Magic, save it to another location, and create a patch
-- of that saved ROM. This lets Lunar Magic apply a VRAM patch that will be required for some things

-- then use the "S - Save" option in Lunar Helper to save your changes to this BPS file so that they appear in your next build.
