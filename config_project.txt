-- this is an example project file
-- (Note: anything on a line after -- is a comment and is ignored by Lunar Helper!)
-- Lunar Helper will load every config_*.txt file in its directory.
-- For a solo project, you could simply configure everything in one big config file,
-- but for collabs it's a good idea to split config files between things that 
-- are relative to the project path like levels, and tools like Lunar Magic that each
-- collaborator may have installed at a different location, as in this example
-- (see config_user.txt for the rest of the example configuration)
 
-- if defined, the initial patch will be applied before any other steps
-- It's good idea to open your clean ROM in Lunar Magic, save it to another location, and create a patch
-- of that saved ROM. This lets Lunar Magic apply a VRAM patch that will be required for some things
-- two initial patches with pretty standard setups are provided with this tool for your convenience

-- Build Order

-- Specifies the order in which resources are inserted
-- into the ROM when you use the Build function, feel free to 
-- move items around or remove them if you're not using them

-- The same step can be specified multiple times if you require things
-- to be inserted two or more times at different points

-- You can also specify individual patches in this list by just 
-- writing out their path as it appears in the patches list above, 
-- this patch will then be inserted at that step instead of being
-- applied at the same time as the other Patches
